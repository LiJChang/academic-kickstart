abstract = "A modification of the Forward Stepwise Regression (FSR), a greedy-type algorithm, is studied in this paper with an emphasis on its application to high-dimensional time series data that is potentially unit-root nonstationary. In particular, a convergence rate of the empirical error is established, and a consistent model selection procedure, the AR-FSR+HDIC+Trim, is then proposed on this foundation. Its performance is illustrated by extensive simulation studies as well as an example application to U.S. macroeconomic data."
